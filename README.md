few test scraping codes

Given a news website (let's just use this link for now: http://www.inc.com/business-insider/google-hardest-interview-questions.html),
 your script should scrape this article for: 
 The title, the date it was published, the author, the content/text of the article, and any embedded videos (or youtube links). 
 Then save the data in separate variables. Ideally this would be written in python or php.

Besides the link above. You'll want ensure it works on these links too:
- http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/02/116_197716.html
- http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/10/world/vancouver-island-human-foot/index.html
- http://nyti.ms/1QYHX77
- http://bit.ly/1TVjbrf (this last one is tricky, but see what you can do)
