 This is often used to “spoof” the User-Agent header, which is used by a browser to identify itself –
 some HTTP servers only allow requests coming from common browsers as opposed to scripts.
  For example, Mozilla Firefox may identify itself as "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U;
 Linux i686) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11", while urllib‘s default user agent string is "Python-urllib/2.6" (on Python 2.6).'''
